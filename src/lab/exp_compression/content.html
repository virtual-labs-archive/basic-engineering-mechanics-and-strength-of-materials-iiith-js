            A compression test is a method for determining the behavior of materials under a compressive load. Compression tests are conducted by loading the test specimen between two plates and then applying a force to the specimen by moving the crossheads together. The compression test is used to determine elastic limit, proportionality limit, yield point, yield strength and compressive strength.

            <p align="justify">
            <strong>Compressive Strength :-</strong> It is the maximum compressive stress that a material is capable of withstanding without fracture. Brittle materials fracture during testing and have a definite compressive strength values. The compressive strength of ductile materials is determined by their degree of distortion during testing.

          Structure components such as columns and struts are subjected to compressive load in applications. These components are made of high compressive strength materials. Not all the materials are strong in compression. Several materials, which are good in tension are poor in compression. Many materials poor in tension are good in compression. Cast iron is one such example. This strength is determined by conducting a compression test. During the test, the specimen is compressed and deformation Vs. the applied is recorded. 
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
           Compression test is just opposite in nature to tensile test. Nature of deformation and fracture is quite different from that in tensile test. Compressive load tends to squeeze the specimen. Brittle materials are generally weak in tension but strong in compression. Hence this test is normally performed on cast iron, cement concrete etc. But ductile materials like Aluminium and mild steel which are strong in tension are also tested in compression.

              Which will have a higher strength: a small specimen or a full size member made of the same material?
               <br/><br/> 
              
              <b>Q3.</b> 
              What is column action? How does the h/d ratio of specimen affect the test result? <br/><br/> 
              
              <b>Q4.</b> 
              How do ductile and brittle materials differ in their behavior in compression test?

              In cylindrical specimen, it is essential to keep h/d &lt; --- to avoid lateral instability due to bucking action.

	      Procedure for the experiment is as follows.
	    </p>
<p align="justify">
1. Dimensions of test piece is measured at 3 different places along its height/length to determine the average c/s area.<br/>
2. Ends of the specimen should be plane. For that the ends are tested on a bearing plate.<br/>
3. The specimen is placed centrally between the two compression plates, such that the center of moving head is vertically above the center of specimen.<br/>
4. Load is applied on the specimen by moving the movable head.<br/>
5. The load and the corresponding contraction are measured at different intervals. The load interval may be as 500kg.<br/>
6. Load is applied until the specimen fails.
